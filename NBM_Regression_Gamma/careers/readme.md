# Next Steps

Congratulations on completing this Short Immersive Course, as you continue to build your new career with the Metis Bootcamp! Now that you have completed a new project you should:

**Data Analytics, Data Science, Data Science and Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning**
* **Update your resume.** Pick a new resume format and add your past experience to the document 
* **Add the "Linear Regression and Web Scraping" project description.** As a starting point, use the ~100 word abstract from each project writeup as your project description. Either now or before the end of the Bootcamp you should edit the text down to adhere to resume best practices. 
* Update your Github repository
* Begin networking! You can start with friends and former colleagues
* Finally, write a blog! Don't forget to:
    - **Link back to the Metis website:** Backlinking when mentioning Metis in your project blog posts is an easy way to add validity to your educational experience and your expertise. When mentioning Metis in a blog post, please link to your specific Bootcamp program page, with "Metis" hyperlinked (e.g. Metis for the Data Science and Machine Learning program)
    - **Share on social media:** We love sharing our students' projects with our community on Twitter!
        - mention us @thisismetis (we will retweet)
        - use the #MadeAtMetis hashtag in your post (we will retweet)

**Note**: many of the resources above are in the EDA repository in the "Introduction to Careers"
