# Sample Lesson Plan

- [CV and Testing Deck](CV_and_testing.key) - Validation/CV and testing workflow breakdown
- [Validation Workflow Code](validation_workflow_and_utilities.ipynb) - Code examples of the validation/testing workflow with a few bonus utility examples (dummy variables, polynomial features, etc.)

# Learning Objectives

With this lesson, students can:

- Understand the importance of estimating generalization error through testing
- Understand how out-of-sample data can also be used for model selection (validation), and why this is different than testing
- Introduce and practice (in code) two common modeling frameworks: train/validation/test and CV/test
