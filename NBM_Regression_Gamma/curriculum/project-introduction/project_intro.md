# Regression Course Project Introduction

## Summary:

Using data scraped from a website, build linear regression models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem in any domain of interest such as movies or sports. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation (to the entire class at the end of week 2) and a short written description. 

Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- **design**, **data**, **algorithms**, **tools**, and **communication** -- that are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the [project success guide](./project_success_guide.md).  

### Design:

*  The project should be centered around a **well-posed regression problem** in a domain of interest that can be reasonably addressed by     available data
*  All **deliverable deadlines should be met**, reflecting **professionalism** and **effective scoping and workflow**

### Data:

*  The **primary data must be acquired through web scraping**
*  Supplemental data obtained through other means is always welcome, but not required
*  Make sure that you have a **continuous, numerical target** variable to predict (e.g. revenue, price, # views, salary, etc.). Aim to have **1000+ data points** and **10+ features** so that you can build a robust model with interesting feature engineering and selection challenges; consult with an instructor if you are considering deviating from this rule of thumb, which is often fine

*  Data from any publicly accessible, scrapeable source is fine, but recommended **sources that are known to be scrapeable** include   
    - movie: boxofficemojo.com, imdb.com   
    - sports: sports-reference.com 
 
### Algorithms

*  Building a **linear regression** in python is required, including the appropriate use of techniques such as **regularization** and/or **polynomial features** and other feature engineering as appropriate 
*  **Rigorous model selection and evaluation** (i.e. proper validation and testing) is required  
*  Other regression methods (beyond those covered in the course) are optional 

### Tools

*  **Web scraping tools** (1+ of BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or another python scraping tool) are required for data acquisition. 

- Other tools not covered in the course are optional but welcome
  - *Storage* tools could include SQL or noSQL (e.g. MongoDB) databases
  - *Processing* tools could include Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services for cloud computing resources
  - *Visualization* tools could include python libraries such as Bokeh and Plotly or resources outside of python such as Tableau
  - *Production* tools could include Flask or other web app libraries/technologies

### Communication:
 
* Students will deliver a **5 minute slide presentation** at the end of the course. These should be given in a compelling, clear manner and include effective visuals for communicating your objectives and findings
* You will also submit a **~1 page written description** summarizing your work: it should begin with a **~100 word abstract** to be followed by a breakdown of your project along the 5 major components


## Deliverables:

**Please submit all project deliverables through the [Student Submissions Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeM7MPx5r_FaX6ordJGkG1ObLh94GEE8qzlvEFxfvmWsKmXNA/viewform)**. All project deliverables and code should be uploaded to a personal, project-specific GitHub repository. Click [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/Metis_Fundamentals/tree/main/git_and_github) for instructions on how to set up a personal repo. 

**For exact deliverable dates, refer to the main schedule [here](/README.md).**
  
**For exact deliverable details, refer to the (linked) Metis Fundamentals project deliverable templates**.

 * [Project proposal](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/tree/master/project_deliverable_templates/project_proposal.md): short description shared with instructors
    - Additionally, students may meet with an instructor for a scope meeting
