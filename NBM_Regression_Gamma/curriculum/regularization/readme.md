# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Regularization Presentation](regularization.pptx)
- [Regularization Code](regularization_code.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students can:

- Understand regularization as a practical strategy for reducing overfitting by punishing model complexity and build intuition for how it works 
- Correctly describe the relationship between regularization and the complexity tradeoff
- Work through an applied example of regularization, reviewing key practical considerations like validation workflows

# Additional Resources

See [additional resources folder](additional_resources) for older material and ElasticNet coding example.
