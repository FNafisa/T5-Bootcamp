# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Feature Engineering Regression](feature_engineering_regression.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students will:

- Get an introduction to simple feature transformations (polynomials) and interactions for improving regression models
- See a worked example of iterative benchmarking to track how much value new features add to current model
- Gain exposure to more complex feature ideas for future work
