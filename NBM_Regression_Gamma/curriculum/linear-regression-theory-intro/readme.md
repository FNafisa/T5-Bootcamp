# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Lab with Solutions](Linear%20Regression%20Theory%20Intro%20Solutions.ipynb)

# Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Apply Linear Regression to the framework taught in the Machine Learning intro lesson.
- Interpret the coefficients of a linear regression model.
- Fit linear regression models using either scikit-learn or statsmodels.
- Predict out-of-sample using a model.
- Recognize and explain limits of models:
  * Models do not determine causation.
  * Models cannot substitute for understanding data.
