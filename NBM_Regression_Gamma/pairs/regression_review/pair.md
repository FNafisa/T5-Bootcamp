Work with your partner to answer the questions below for each of these regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression 

Feel free to use the internet as needed. We will randomly call on you to answer questions when we review! 

    1) Is it interpretable?
    2) Does it perform feature selection?
    3) What types of feature vs. target relationships does it need to work well?
    4) How and how well does it handle multi-colinearity?
    5) How can you adjust the quality of the fit (prevent underfitting and overfitting)?
    6) How does it handle feature interactions?
    7) Is it good with diverse (non-homogenous) sets of features? (think variables of different types, on different scales, etc.)
    8) Is it scalable with large number of features and data points (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?

Optionally, give a business use case where each algorithm would be most or least appropriate.

If you have extra time, do some research into the following models and see if you can answer some of the questions for them as well: Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor.
