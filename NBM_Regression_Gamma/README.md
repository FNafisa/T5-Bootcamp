# Prerequisites

<details><summary> Summary of prerequisite skills required to succeed in this course (click to expand) </summary>
 
* Students should be proficient in general python, pandas, and basic visualization libraries -- able to comfortably use these tools in order to explore, analyze, and visualize tabular datasets 
* Students should be comfortable with the mathematics fundamentals of machine learning including calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics
 
</details>

# Learning Objectives

<details><summary> Actionable, assessed learning goals for this course, broken out by category (click to expand) </summary>
  
**Machine Learning Fundamentals**
 
1. Use proper machine learning terminology to precisely describe modeling applications, matching different modeling approaches to their appropriate use. 
2. Precisely relate the theoretical concept of predictive model complexity (bias/variance tradeoff) to model building and tuning in practice.
3. Effectively and appropriately describe and apply model selection and evaluation techniques, including validation, cross-validation, and testing.

**Web Scraping**
 
1.  Correctly describe the purpose and applications of python scraping libraries, including their respective strengths and limitations.
2.  Demonstrate proficiency in web scraping syntax, successfully leveraging it to navigate HTML hierarchy and extract information from it.

**Linear Regression Theory and Evaluation**

1. Correctly express the fundamentals of linear regression models, including their functional form, cost function, and theoretical assumptions and limitations.
2. Properly define and interpret key regression evaluation metrics including R<sup>2</sup> and mean absolute error.
3. Formally describe regularized linear regression, including its relationship with the bias/variance tradeoff, regularized cost functions, and the major practical differences between LASSO and ridge regularization. 

**Linear Regression in Application**

1. Demonstrate ability to properly use the data handling and preprocessing techniques that are most commonly leveraged by linear regression models, including handling of categorical data, outliers, null/missing values, and scaling.
2. Properly interpret visual information as it relates to linear regression modeling, using it to gain insight into feature-target relationships and generate feature engineering ideas. 
3. Effectively apply linear regression concepts to real-world business problems, determining useful features and which success metrics and techniques (including time series methods and mini-batch gradient descent) are appropriate for the problem.

# Completion Requirements

In order to successfully complete the course, students are required to:

* Complete a project with a score of 15 or above (refer to the [project introduction](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_intro.md) and [project success guide](./curriculum/project-introduction/project_success_guide.md))

* <details><summary> Receive an average score of at least 60% across the assessments (click to expand) </summary>

   There will be assessments throughout the course (refer to the schedule above); students will be given access to an assessment to complete at that time. Each assessment will consist of 20 multiple choice questions (with four options per question), which students will have 60 minutes to complete. The assessments are open-book.
   
   The assessment will have questions related to the learning objectives detailed above. The objectives give a roadmap of which areas should be focused on in preparation.

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
