    "- There are three main definitions to understand before we begin exploring Linear Algebra:\n",
    "> 1. __Linear:__ The \"linear\" component in Linear Algebra says that the objects we will deal with will be \"straight\" or \"flat\", versus a \"curved\" or \"sloped\" objects which are out of the scope of this course and covered in \"non-linear\" system analysis\n",
    "> 2. __[Linear Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation):__ Linear Equations take simple forms and primarily deal with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (although addition and multiplication are by far, more common)\n",
    "> 3. __[Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra):__ You are likely familiar with the term \"algebra\" from high school and it is used to refer the manipulation and use of mathemtical symbols\n",
