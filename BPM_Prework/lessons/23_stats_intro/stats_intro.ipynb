    "> 1. __[`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/stats.html):__ The `stats` module in the SciPy Package offers many Statistical functions such as mean, zscore, correlation as well as other sub-modules for Continuous Distributions, Multivariate Distributions, and Discrete Distributions\n",

    ">> - Descriptive Statistics can take the form of simple metrics known as summary statistics (i.e. number of observations, minimum value, maximum value, mean, variance, etc.) or they can take the form of visualizations (i.e. histograms, scatterplots, pie charts, box plots, etc.) \n",
    ">> - Examples of Descriptive Statistics:<br>\n",
    ">> >__a.__ 75th percentile of height of men in the United States<br> \n",
    ">> >__b.__ Mean Field Goal Percentage of a professional baskebtall player in the NBA<br> \n",
    ">> >__c.__ Median salary of Data Scientistis across every major metropolitan area in the United States <br>\n",
    "> 2. __[Inferential Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference):__ The purpose of Inferential Statistics is to make inferences about a population using a subset of the population known as a sample \n",
    ">> - Inferential Statistics begin with a hypothesis about the population and then the sample is used to prove or disprove the hypoothesis, effectively inferring something about the population\n",
    ">> - Examples of Inferential Statistics: <br>\n",
    ">> >__a.__ Survey is sent out to 1000 residents in Chicago asking them about their political views. The survey designers are interested in knowing if Chicago residents in different areas have more or less conservative views. <br>\n",

    "1. It is important to understand that the purpose of Descriptive Statistics is to simply collect and record metrics and nothing more. It does NOT involve any generalization beyond the summary statistics \n",
    "2. In an experiment it is common to use both Descriptive AND Inferential Statistics "
