    "- __[Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem):__ The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental concept in Statistics and states that regardless of the original Probability Distribution, if you repeatedly sample from this distribution with sample size n (as n approaches infinity) and then plot the distribution of these sample means, your distribution will approach a Normal Distribution \n",
    "> - You can also take the sample sums and then plot the sample sums and the sampling distribution will approach a Normal Distribution\n",
    "> - As the sample size (n) grows, the distribution of the sample means will approach a more \"perfect\" Normal Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. We actually observed the Central Limit Theorem in the previous examples where the original distriution was Uniform and after plotting the sample means of 10,000 samples, the distribution looks very normal. This fact is true for any original distribution \n",
    "2. Although technically the \"perfect\" Normal Distribution is only achieved as n approaches infinity, it is sufficient to have a sample size of 5, 10, 25, etc. to achieve an \"almost perfect\" Normal Distribution \n",
