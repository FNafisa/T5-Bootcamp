    "- __[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/):__ NumPy, which stands for \"Numerical Python\", is the fundamental package for performing \"scientific computation\" in Python \n",
    "- Python's original intention was NOT for [Numerical Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) and therefore required additional tools to do this type of analysis \n",
    "- In recent years, the NumPy Package has become a staple in the Data Scientist's toolbox for some of the following reasons:\n",
    "> 1. NumPy is the foundation on which all higher-level tools used by Data Scientists are built on such as [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "> 2. The NumPy Array is also the fundamental building block on top of which Tensor objects are built in [`TensorFlow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/) which is a popular package for [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) in Python \n",
    "> 3. As a Data Scientist, it is common to deal with large arrays that have many rows and columns as well as third dimensions (i.e. think about the pixels of an image). NumPy Arrays allow you store these large arrays in an efficient manner \n",
    "> 4. As a Data Scientist, it is a common task to perform operations on an entire array. NumPy Arrays allow you to do this without the use of `for` loops\n",
    "> 5. Linear Algebra is a core mathematical concept that is absolutely essential to becoming a Data Scientist and the NumPy Package has many internal functions for performing beginner to advanced routines in Linear Alebgra\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now you understand why Data Scientists use the NumPy Package, but what is it about the NumPy Package that allow us, as users of the NumPy Package, to realize these benefits? \n",
    "> 1. NumPy's main object is the Multi-Dimensional [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type#Multi-dimensional_arrays) which is extremely fast and convenient for working with data sets \n",
    "> 2. NumPy's arrays allow us to perform [vectorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization) operations on entire arrays which means the same operation is applied all at once rather than to each individual elements one at a time (like `for` loops)\n",
    "> 3. The NumPy Package has hundred's of functions grouped into about 30 categories which can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.html). Some of the most important functions for Data Scientists can be found in the following groups:\n",
    ">> a. __[Mathematical Functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.math.html):__ Mathematical Functions include trigonemtric functions, hyperbolic functions, sums/products/differences, exponents and logarithms, etc.<br>\n",
    ">> b. __[Statistics](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.statistics.html):__ Statistics Functions including averages, variances, correlation, histograms, etc.<br> \n",
    ">> c. __[Linear Algebra](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.linalg.html):__ Matrix and Vector Products, Decompositions, Solving Equations, etc. "

    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. A few key definitions will be important to understand before we start working with arrays. In NumPy:\n",
    ">> a. __Axis__: An array's axis refers to the number of __[Dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension)__ in the array (i.e. a one-dimensional array such as `[1,2,3]` has 1 axis)<br>\n",
    ">> b. __Rank__: Rank of an array refers to the number of axes in the array (i.e. a two-dimensional array such as:\n",
    ">> > `[[1,2,3],`<br>\n",
    ">> >  `[4,5,6]]` has rank 2 because it has 2 axes (and it has 2 axes, because it has 2 dimensions - one along the rows and one along the columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, NumPy considers __Dimensions__, __Axes__, and __Rank__ to mean the same thing\n",
    ">> c. __Length__: Length of an array refers to the number of elements in each axis (i.e. a two-dimensional array such as:<br>\n",
    ">> > `[[1,0,0],`<br>\n",
    ">> >  `[0,1,2]]` has length 2 in its first axis (rows) and length 3 in its second axis (columns) )"

    "- When we create arrays, they are made as an `ndarray` object, also known as just an `array` object\n",

    "> 1. __Dimension:__ Dimension of an array can be accessed by `ndarray.ndim`\n",
    "> 2. __Shape:__ Shape of an array can be accessed by `ndarray.shape`. Shape provides a tuple of integers indicating the length of the array in each dimension. For example, shape is (n, m) for an array with n rows and m columns\n",
    "> 3. __Size:__ Size of an array can be accessed by `ndarray.size`. SIze refers to the total number of elements of the array (product of the elements of `shape`)\n",
    "> 4. __Type:__ The type of elements in the array can be accessed by `ndarray.dtype`. Array types can either be the standard Python types or NumPy specific types: `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int16`, and `numpy.float64`\n",
    "> 5. __[Row-Major Ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order):__ NumPy arrays are \"filled\" by rows. For example in an array of size (2, 2), the cells would be filled in the following order: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), rather than Column-Major Ordering which is filled in this order: (1,1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)\n",

    "2. See below to see how these characteristics are examined in NumPy arrays \n",
    "3. It is useful to note that Python also has an `array` object, but it only supports one-dimensional arrays and has much less functionality compared to NumPy. To access the Python `array` object, you must use import the `array` module. You can read about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html)\n",

    "We can see that using the `np.ix_` function, we are able to get the same 4 diagonals of the array. However, notice how the row and column indexes are now lists (`[0,2]` and `[0,2]`, respectively), compared to the array row and columns indexes above when `np.ix_` was not used. There is some \"deep\" stuff happening behind the scenes here based on a concept called __Broadcasting__ that will be explained later. At this point, it is okay to think about the `np.ix_` function as making the process of accessing elements more efficient as it achieves it with less arguments.
