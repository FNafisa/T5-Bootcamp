# EDA Course Project Success Guide

Metis projects are graded by point assignments for five component parts, each on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 3 on a 
component indicates that the project requirements for that component have been well met, while scores below and above 3 
respectively indicate that requirements are not met or are significantly exceeded. The components are: **design**, **data**, 
**algorithms**, **tools**, and **communication**. A total score of 15 (average of 3 per component) is required to successfully 
pass the course.

For specific instructions on this project's requirements, refer to the [project introduction](./project_intro.md). 
Below are guidelines mapping out the typical project factors in each component that lead to a score of 3, as well as 
those that help contribute to being below or above a 3. 
**Note that these factors are guidelines and are not prescriptive**; instructors will ultimately grade based on their 
careful judgement in conjunction with these guidelines, 
so it is not a good idea to try to "game" these guidelines. 

If in doubt about expectations or a score received, you may always consult the instructional team.

**Important note on deliverable deadlines**: Refer to the [daily schedule](../../README.md) for all project deliverables and their deadlines, both intermediate (project proposal, MVP) and final (slides, writeup and code). If you submit your final deliverable later than 11 am ET on presentation day, you will receive a 1 point penalty under the Design category. If you don't submit by 3 pm ET on that day, **we will not be able to grade your project and you will not pass the course**. Any exceptional circumstances should be discussed with your instructors and program manager as soon as possible. You should also meet the intermediate deliverable deadlines  -- your ability to keep to deadlines and display professionalism in your project work will be scored under the design category.

### Design:

*  **Satisfactory**: A clearly defined client backstory is appropriately addressed through the project. All deliverable deadlines are met.  

*  **Below**: The project does not clearly define a client backstory, or does not appropriately address the proposed client backstory. Deliverable deadlines are not met.
*  **Above**: The clearly defined client backstory is exceptionally creative and involved, and is addressed in a highly proficient manner.

### Data:

*  **Satisfactory**: The MTA data selected for analysis is sufficient to address the client problem.

*  **Below**: The MTA data selected for analysis is small or overly simple, or inadequate for appropriately understanding the client problem. 
*  **Above**: The MTA data selected for analysis is large in scale, spanning an extensive period of time.
Multiple datasets are leveraged via merging disparate sources, 
enabling a broader and deeper analysis of the client problem.  
 
### Algorithms

*  **Satisfactory**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques are effectively used to clean, aggregate, and visualize the data. Patterns and insights obtainable from the data are interpreted correctly.

*  **Below**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques are ineffectively or insufficiently used, or 
patterns and insights obtainable from the data are interpreted incorrectly.       
*  **Above**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to an exceptional level of depth or breadth.
Non-obvious patterns and insights obtainable from the data are extracted and interpreted using methods beyond what was covered
in the course. 

### Tools

*  **Satisfactory**: SQL is effectively used for data ingestion, storage, and extraction into Python via SQLAlchemy.
Python packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization, including pandas and matplotlib, are effectively used 
to clean, aggregate, and visualize the data. 

*  **Below**: SQL is not used for data ingestion, storage, and extraction, or is used incorrectly. 
Python packages for exploratory data analysis are not used, or are used trivially or incorrectly.

*  **Above**: SQL is used to an advanced degree, including exploration and cleaning of the data. 
Python packages for exploratory data analysis are used to an advanced degree, beyond what was covered in the course. 
Significant data/engineering tools not covered in the course are used.

- Major examples of applicable tools not covered in the course:
  - *Acquisition* tools could include web scraping libraries or use of APIs
  - *Processing* tools could include Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services for cloud computing resources
  - *Visualization* tools could include more advanced Python libraries such as Bokeh and Plotly or resources outside of 
  Python such as Tableau


### Communication:
 
*  **Satisfactory**: Presentation is in line with time requirements, clear in structure and delivery, and includes 
reasonable visualizations. Written description is similarly clear and in line with length expectations.

*  **Below**: Presentation is well out of line with time requirements, delivered poorly, confusing, or lacking in visualizations. 
Written description is unclear and poorly structured.
*  **Above**: Presentation has exceptional delivery, extremely clear structure, compelling in narrative and 
selection/construction of visualizations throughout. Slides are beautiful in style and design, carefully curated to 
draw attention to key information and complement the verbal delivery.
